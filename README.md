Overview
The Shopping List App is a convenient tool designed to manage your shopping experience efficiently. It allows you to keep track of items you plan to purchase, tallying up the total cost as you shop. Once you've bought an item, you can easily move it to the "Bought" section, where the app will calculate the total of your purchased goods, helping you to stay within budget.

Features
Add Items: Easily add items to your shopping list along with their price.
Calculate Total: Automatically calculate the total price of items on your shopping list and the items you have already bought.
Manage Items: Move items from your shopping list to the bought list as you purchase them.
View Balance: Keep an eye on how much you have spent against the total balance of your current list.
